# IPL Win Probability
## Overview
Welcome to the IPL Win Probability project! This repository focuses on predicting the win probability of IPL matches. The project involves understanding the variables through basic data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing of data, along with visualizing and statistically exploring the data. The Python model is developed using the deliveries and matches tables. Additionally, the model is deployed using Streamlit in PyCharm software, creating a local website for testing.
